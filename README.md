##  Overview

SeedUp is a very powerful Python based tool that combines torrent downloading with Google Drive uploading capabilities. It's designed to work both as a standalone application and in Google Colab environments, making it perfect for managing downloads without using local resources.

Perfect for users who need to download large files through torrents and automatically store them in cloud storage, especially useful in resource-constrained environments like Google Colab's free tier.

##  Features

-  **High-speed torrent downloading** using libtorrent
-  **Automatic Google Drive upload** with seamless authentication
-  **Resume capability** for interrupted downloads
-  **Real-time progress tracking** with visual progress bars
-  **Smart duplicate detection** - skip already uploaded files
-  **Flexible input support** - both magnet links and .torrent files
-  **Google Colab optimized** with automatic environment detection
-  **Secure authentication** handling for Google Drive API
-  **Organized uploads** with configurable destination folders
-  **Command-line interface** for advanced users

##  Installation

### For Google Colab (Recommended)
Simply open the [SeedUp Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/codercyco/SeedUp/blob/main/SeedUp.ipynb) and follow the step-by-step guide. No manual installation required!

### For Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codercyco/SeedUp.git
   cd SeedUp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install libtorrent:**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install python3-libtorrent
   
   # macOS
   brew install libtorrent-rasterbar
   
   # Or via pip (may require compilation)
   pip install libtorrent
   ```
<br>

## Quick Start
### In Google Colab (Easiest)
1. Click here to Open [SeedUp Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/codercyco/SeedUp/blob/main/SeedUp.ipynb)
2. Follow the step-by-step cells
3. Authentication and setup is handled automatically

### Command Line Usage

#### Download torrent only:
```bash
python main.py download -t "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."
python main.py download -t movie.torrent
```

#### Download and upload to Google Drive:
```bash
# Uploads to 'SeedUp Downloads' folder in Drive root (created automatically)
python main.py download -t "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..." --upload

# Upload to a specific folder (optional)
python main.py download -t "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..." --upload -f FOLDER_ID
```

#### Upload existing files to Google Drive:
```bash
# Uploads to 'SeedUp Downloads' folder in Drive root (created automatically)
python main.py upload -p /path/to/folder

# Upload to a specific folder (optional)
python main.py upload -p /path/to/folder -f FOLDER_ID
```

#### Check download status:
```bash
python main.py status
```

#### Clear session:
```bash
python main.py clear
```

### Advanced Options

- `--no-resume`: Start fresh download (ignore previous session)
- `--no-skip`: Force re-upload even if files exist in Drive
- `-d PATH`: Custom download destination
- `-f FOLDER_ID`: Google Drive folder ID for uploads (optional - defaults to SeedUp Downloads folder in Drive root)

##  Features

### Automatic SeedUp Downloads Folder
- **Auto-creates 'SeedUp Downloads' folder** in your Google Drive root directory
- **Smart detection** - uses existing folder if already present
- **Optional custom folders** - you can still specify a different folder ID if needed
- All uploads go to SeedUp Downloads folder by default for organized storage

```

##  Configuration

### Google Drive Setup

**No manual setup required!** SeedUp automatically:
1. Creates a 'SeedUp Downloads' folder in your Google Drive root (or uses existing one)
2. Handles authentication in Google Colab automatically
3. Uploads all files to the SeedUp Downloads folder by default

**Optional: Using a Custom Folder**
1. **Get Folder ID:**
   - Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
   - Navigate to your target folder
   - Copy the folder ID from the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID_HERE`
2. **Use with -f flag:**
   ```bash
   python main.py download -t "magnet..." --upload -f YOUR_FOLDER_ID
   ```

### Environment Variables
Key configuration options in `config.py`:

```python
TORRENT_DOWNLOAD_PATH = "../SeedUp Downloads"  # Default download path
CHUNK_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024                 # 100MB upload chunks
MAX_RETRIES = 3                                # Upload retry attempts
LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD = 1024 * 1024 * 1024      # 1GB threshold
```

##  Use Cases

### Perfect for:

- **Anyone**: Who needs cloud storage for torrent downloads

### Environments:
- ✅ **Google Colab** (Recommended - zero setup)
- ✅ **Local Linux/macOS** (With proper dependencies)
